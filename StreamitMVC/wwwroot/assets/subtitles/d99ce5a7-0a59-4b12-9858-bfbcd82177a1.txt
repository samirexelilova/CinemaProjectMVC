00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,125
Babe, are you out here?

2
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,458
Yeah.

3
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,249
Thought you might be.

4
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,624
I have to go soon.

5
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,958
Okay. Okay, I'm comin'.

6
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,457
Come say goodbye to me.

7
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,166
-Coffee?
-Good call.

8
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,407
-Would you make one while I finish packing?
-Of course.

9
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,083
Car should be here in a minute.

10
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,916
Thank you.

11
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,166
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>West bound is experiencing
heavy traffic...</i>

13
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,166
<i>starting from the 610 Garret
road exit and stretching...</i>

14
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:38,416
What am I gonna do without
your coffee for five days?

15
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,958
-They have coffee in London.
-Do they?

16
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,499
You sound really sure for
somebody who's never been.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,666
Five days? I thought
you said four.

18
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,958
Yeah. Four days there, and
then I'm back on the overnight.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Right.

20
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,583
You can still come, you know.

21
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:54,499
I can't.

22
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,791
I mean, there's somethin' I'm
tryin' to untangle at work.

23
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,041
Come on.

24
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,667
Just this once. Take a risk.

25
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,792
Next time. I promise.

26
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,499
This is a list of things
that need to be watered.

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,082
Thursday morning, don't
forget to leave your key

28
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,458
-for Mike and his son for the boiler.
-Right.

29
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,124
Those should last
until I get home.

30
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,375
Remind you of me.

31
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,124
Don't need reminding.

32
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,291
No?

33
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,749
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,124
I'll be fine.

35
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,292
Come on.

36
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,042
Love you.

37
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,749
-Bye.
-Bye.

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,292
Bye.

39
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,333
Bye!

40
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,000
{\an8}Good to see you,
brother. Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,999
{\an8}-What's going on, Chuck?
-Hey.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,582
{\an8}Hey, you just back
from somewhere?

43
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,666
{\an8}Across the pond, man.
Everywhere and nowhere.

44
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:50,582
-You know how it is.
-Yeah.

45
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,332
You just buzzin'
in and buzzin' out?

46
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,624
Yeah. I got a day of
security debrief...

47
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,957
and then, it's the
home base, man.

48
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,291
Go kiss my little girl.

49
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,499
That's important.

50
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,124
Yeah. I just said
goodbye to my wife.

51
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,885
Hey, man, what are you
doing for lunch today?

52
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,874
-Nothin'. No, no plans.
-Yeah?

53
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,249
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm completely free, man.
-That's great.

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,749
You know, I got
this computer shit.

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,041
Just a few, like, bits and bytes

56
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,707
I would love to get that big
brain of yours to decipher.

57
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,874
I swear, last time,
bro, you saved my life.

58
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,207
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

59
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,624
-Yeah, of course.
-That's great. All right.

60
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,749
So, you go ahead and
you eat your lunch,

61
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,415
then I'll come get ya?

62
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,999
{\an8}-Yeah.
-My man.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,542
{\an8}Tick tock, tick boom, bro.

64
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,167
{\an8}<i>Floor Minus Two. Operations.</i>

65
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,958
{\an8}<i>Floor Minus Five.

66
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,166
<i>Hello. Are you there, Charlie?</i>

67
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,042
{\an8}What do you have for me
today, Señor Inquiline?

68
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,374
<i>2.1 terabyte tranche.</i>

69
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,749
<i>Kabul Station.</i>

70
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,499
<i>2014 to 2022.</i>

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
<i>Open this alone.</i>

72
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,458
<i>No charge this time.</i>

73
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,167
How's the weather in Istanbul?

74
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,208
<i>Nice try.</i>

75
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:51,958
It's just a matter of time.

76
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,124
<i>You think?</i>

77
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,124
<i>It's been five years, Charlie,
and you're still guessing.</i>

78
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,416
I'll get there.

79
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,958
I like puzzles.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,082
<i>Not as much as I like anonymity.</i>

81
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,207
If I had to guess, you're a 50-year-old
Russian man living in Istanbul...

82
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,708
with an affinity for Reddit
boards and Turkish coffee.

83
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,416
<i>Perhaps, perhaps not.</i>

84
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,582
<i>I'm serious. Be
careful with this data.</i>

85
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,292
<i>It's highly compromising
for your agency.</i>

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,957
Hey.

87
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,166
Hi, Team.

88
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,582
Tell me again. How big
did you say the crate was?

89
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,416
Twenty meters by 10.

90
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,624
Another one of
Slater's hypotheticals.

91
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,499
Satellite images of a crate
on the back of a semi-truck...

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,332
rectangular in shape,
20 by 10 meters.

93
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,499
Destination?

94
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,791
A major metropolitan area.

95
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,791
-LA.
-Wrong coast.

96
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,333
Is the truck from Pennsylvania?

97
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,791
Headed to DC?

98
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,124
So far, so good.

99
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,332
-A flagpole.
-No, a missile.

100
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,542
Christmas tree.

101
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,916
The White House tree always comes from
a farm in Lehighton, Pennsylvania.

102
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,916
And dimensions of the
truck tell the rest.

103
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,417
-He can be really annoying sometimes.
-Wow.

104
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,167
Who's that?

105
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,249
The most dangerous
man in the building.

106
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,874
Secret agent. Bang, bang.

107
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,082
He and Heller are besties.

108
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,249
I'm his bestie.

109
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,292
We're just acquaintances.

110
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:30,792
How do you know him?

111
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,458
Saved his life.

112
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,291
Heller.

113
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:51,708
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

114
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,374
Sarah?

115
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,125
<i>No. Saddam Hussein.</i>

116
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,250
He's dead.

117
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,791
Humor, Heller.

118
00:07:58,792 --> 00:07:59,832
<i>Right, right.</i>

119
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,457
I'm just calling to
let you know I'm here.

120
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,207
Right. I know. I
know. I tracked you.

121
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,416
<i>I'd be hurt if you didn't.</i>

122
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,791
I'm just grabbing a coffee.

123
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,874
Trying to keep me awake a little bit longer
while I wait for the rest of the team.

124
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,999
All right. Take a walk. Go
get some fresh air, honey.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,749
But I want to lie down.

126
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,667
No. If you lie down,
you'll never get up.

127
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:19,166
Is that sage advice
from the world traveler?

128
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,249
Harsh.

129
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,207
Hey, listen. I'm on
to something here.

130
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,458
Can I call you later?

131
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,082
Yeah. I love you.

132
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,332
I love you, babe. Bye. Bye.

133
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,791
-Bye. Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

134
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,875
-Bye.
<i>-Bye-bye.</i>

135
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:57,083
What the hell?

136
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,916
<i>There are witness reports
of a drone strike...</i>

137
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:04,999
{\an8}<i>but U.S. sources have confirmed
that it was a suicide bomber.</i>

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,291
<i>-The scale of the attacks devastated...
-Some 150 people killed...</i>

139
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:10,499
<i>including French special forces.</i>

140
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,957
{\an8}<i>Seven Danish marines were
killed in the explosion...</i>

141
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,124
<i>which was initially reported
as a misdirected air strike.</i>

142
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,582
<i>A Department of
Defense spokesman...</i>

143
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,582
<i>denied reports of U.S. Air
Force operations in the area...</i>

144
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,166
<i>blaming the attack
on local insurgents.</i>

145
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,792
Chief Moore.

146
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,125
Hey, buddy.

147
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,375
Carlos.

148
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,332
You okay? You look
like a damn ghost.

149
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,417
I was just rectifying some...

150
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,041
Charlie?

151
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,333
Some files.

152
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,833
Okay.

153
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,082
I may have looked
somewhere I shouldn't have.

154
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,332
Within our department?

155
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,374
Gray area.

156
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,082
We don't do gray areas, Charlie.

157
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,666
Our work is decidedly binary.

158
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,166
Then, no.

159
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,832
In that case, what you
do is you keep quiet.

160
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,833
Yeah.

161
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,207
<i>Hey, I'm either busy or dropped
my cell at the bottom of my bag.</i>

162
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,458
<i>Tell me who you are
and I'll call you back.</i>

163
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,542
Hey, it's me.

164
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,542
Miss you.

165
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,250
I will water the
flowers first thing.

166
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,042
Call me.

167
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,917
-Chief Moore.
-Charlie.

168
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,832
I'm sorry, I don't see you
down here very often, sir.

169
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,833
Why would you?

170
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,624
Nice office you have.

171
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,375
Yeah. Yeah, if you don't
like sunlight or fresh air.

172
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,457
For a moss or a
lichen or mushrooms...

173
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,542
Charlie, have you been
tracking the news?

174
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,458
Well, I'm still tryin' to
find an outlet I can trust.

175
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,728
That's what we thought when we
heard you were here this morning.

176
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,666
We?

177
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,125
I need you to come with me
to the Director's office.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,125
Please.

179
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,583
<i>Floor Seven. Executive.</i>

180
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,292
Director.

181
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,333
Director O'Brien, this
is Charlie Heller.

182
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,667
-Hi.
-Hello, Charlie. Come have a seat.

183
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,125
I'd rather not.

184
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,333
Mr. Heller, I'm afraid there
was a situation in London.

185
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Have you heard?

186
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,249
London?

187
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,375
An attack at the
Christopher Street Hotel.

188
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,292
-Charlie...
-No, no.

189
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,874
I'm very sorry, Mr. Heller.

190
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,457
What?

191
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,417
-Your wife has been killed.
-No.

192
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,207
No, she's at a conference.

193
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,416
We should call her.

194
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,041
-Charlie, I'm very sorry to give you this...
-Can we call her?

195
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:18,333
I have to call her.

196
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,812
Charlie, I think you
need to see this.

197
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,082
<i>We're following a breaking
news story here in London...</i>

198
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,249
<i>where a terrifying hostage
situation unfolded...</i>

199
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,249
<i>at the Christopher Street
Hotel earlier today.</i>

200
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,041
<i>Four assailants
stormed into the hotel,</i>

201
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,999
<i>taking a number of
individuals hostage.</i>

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,582
<i>Two individuals sadly
lost their lives...</i>

203
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,999
<i>including an American woman...</i>

204
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,749
<i>-who was taken hostage during the ordeal.</i>
-It doesn't say it's her.

205
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,249
<i>-Eyewitnesses report a chaotic scene...</i>
-Charlie, you have to believe us.

206
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,124
<i>...inside the hotel as the
perpetrators forced their way...</i>

207
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,082
This is footage we pulled
from surveillance cams.

208
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,374
<i>...terrorized the
guests and the staff.</i>

209
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,916
<i>One of the victims
has been identified.</i>

210
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,332
<i>She is a 32-year-old
American woman...</i>

211
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,207
<i>that was tragically taken
hostage by the assailants.</i>

212
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,500
<i>The police are
not revealing her.</i>

213
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,791
It's all right.

214
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,333
I got this. Don't
worry about it.

215
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,875
Charlie, Charlie, wait!

216
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,625
Charles! Charles!

217
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,124
<i>Metropolitan Police has
initiated a citywide manhunt.</i>

218
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,666
<i>They are working tirelessly
to locate the assailants...</i>

219
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:53,750
<i>and secure the rescue and
release of the hostage...</i>

220
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,832
How can we not know more?

221
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,667
This was in London...

222
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,249
947,000 cameras.

223
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,166
They drove into traffic.

224
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,082
Nobody is getting
away with this.

225
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,541
You have my word.

226
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,833
Okay.

227
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,374
Tell me what we know so far.

228
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,999
Mr. Heller...

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,333
with respect, let
us handle this.

230
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,999
Forgive me, sir, I don't
believe we've officially met.

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,666
I'm the one who's gonna
ensure that those who did this

232
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,291
are held to account.

233
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,167
And what would that look
like, sir, with respect...

234
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,374
being "held to account"?

235
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,250
Look, we can't get
into specifics yet.

236
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,333
Of course, you understand that.

237
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,542
We'll tell you what we
can as soon as we can.

238
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,207
You just said what
he said, only nicer.

239
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,124
Go home, Charlie.

240
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,208
You need to take some time.

241
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,625
-Next of kin?
-Yes.

242
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,332
<i>The suspects arrived
via the service entrance</i>

243
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,124
<i>around 11:00 hours.</i>

244
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,124
<i>The vehicle had been
stolen overnight</i>

245
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,916
at about 01:24 in the East End.

246
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,625
Prints, DNA, all
professionally scrubbed out.

247
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,625
{\an8}Four-person team.

248
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,166
{\an8}Appears they had a meeting...

249
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,249
with Impact Investments out
of Indonesia on our radar.

250
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,875
This is when it all started.

251
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,416
Something must have
got heated inside,

252
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,416
it spilled out
into the corridor.

253
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,583
Impact's security
detail got jumpy,

254
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,250
and one of the four drew on him.

255
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,667
One dead, one critical.

256
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,375
{\an8}<i>Hotel security are alerted, and
the police have been called.</i>

257
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,667
<i>The suspects are now in a
race to leave the building...</i>

258
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
<i>and they decided to
grab some insurance.</i>

259
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:30,167
<i>Everyone! Get down!</i>

260
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:32,875
<i>Everyone down.</i>

261
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,082
<i>Get down. Get down.</i>

262
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,416
<i>No, no, no. Run. Run.</i>

263
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,667
<i>They only took Sarah because
she tried to save someone else.</i>

264
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,582
<i>You do as I say.</i>

265
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,667
<i>Move!</i>

266
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,250
<i>You do as I say. Move!</i>

267
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,417
<i>You do as I say. Move!</i>

268
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,416
<i>The man who took Sarah
is Mishka Blazhic.</i>

269
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:06,332
<i>Origins in Belarus, though
often based in Moscow.</i>

270
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,625
<i>They fled the conference
room with three hostages.</i>

271
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,708
<i>Stay down, or I'll shoot you!</i>

272
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,374
<i>This man, Lawrence
Ellish, is South African.</i>

273
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,041
<i>Ex-special forces.</i>

274
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:22,583
<i>Ellish seems to handle
shipments for the wider group.</i>

275
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:26,332
<i>Armed police and security were
arriving from St. Pancras Station...</i>

276
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,333
<i>but were ordered to hold
back because of the hostages.</i>

277
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,541
<i>Police sealed off the area,
marksmen in position...</i>

278
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:37,667
<i>but the suspects are
exposed, and they knew it.</i>

279
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,917
<i>-Armed police! Drop your weapons!
-Get down!</i>

280
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,624
<i>Sarah's killer is
harder to track.</i>

281
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,667
He seems to sense the
cameras. He says nothing.

282
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,957
{\an8}But I processed all the
CCTV, cell phones...

283
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,624
{\an8}dash cams, body cams...

284
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,708
and the audio to give us a 360.

285
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,125
And that provides us with an ID.

286
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,666
This is Horst Schiller.

287
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,832
Loose affiliations with dozens
of mercs and defense groups.

288
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,541
I'm still filling that in.

289
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,582
They seem to be
operating as interface...

290
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,666
between bad state actors
and terrorist entities.

291
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,083
All business.

292
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,042
And they keep getting hired.

293
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:31,166
But for this one, I
have a current location.

294
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,832
Gretchen Frank.

295
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,500
Former Armenian IO.

296
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,583
She's in Paris.

297
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,125
Buys her bread at this cafe.

298
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,583
Turns up there regularly.

299
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,333
You knew this?

300
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,542
Thank you.

301
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,333
-We'll do a comparison.
-Wait.

302
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,041
You already know
about Gretchen Frank?

303
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:01,083
I understand you wanna
see progress, Charlie.

304
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,333
But sometimes, the best
course of action...

305
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,708
isn't always the most obvious.

306
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:07,791
"Most obvious"?

307
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,707
We want the whole network.

308
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,624
The network has nothing
to do with Sarah.

309
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,666
But everything to do
with the sovereignty

310
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,833
and security of this country.

311
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:21,917
What you do is very important
to what we do, Charlie.

312
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:26,167
We think it would be good
for you to see Dr. Garrison.

313
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:35,000
Am I here for me or the Agency?

314
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:39,666
It is important we assess you're
well enough to return to work.

315
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,875
Obviously.

316
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,708
But you've suffered
a terrible loss.

317
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,250
And we want to support you.

318
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,792
Can you describe your feelings?

319
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,708
Right now?

320
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,666
You mean, denial, anger...

321
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:57,917
acceptance...

322
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,250
Say more.

323
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,750
She's gone.

324
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,125
Yeah, that she had
to go like that.

325
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,625
And that I didn't speak to her
on the phone when she called.

326
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,042
-And you blame yourself for that?
-Yes.

327
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,291
For not going with her
when she asked me to,

328
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,792
because I never do.

329
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,500
Never did.

330
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,208
And what is that
making you feel?

331
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,167
Pretty useless.

332
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:58,250
Angry.

333
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,167
Very, very angry.

334
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:12,707
I gave the Agency the
names of Sarah's killers.

335
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,000
They did nothing.

336
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,042
-What do you want them to do?
-Their job!

337
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,708
I want them to go
after Sarah's killers.

338
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,500
Will that make you feel better?

339
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,332
This shouldn't be about me.

340
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,792
Sarah mattered.

341
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,292
She deserves more.

342
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,125
But in the end,
this is about you.

343
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,333
Sarah's gone.

344
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,333
You are gonna have to try
and come to terms with that.

345
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,667
I can help.

346
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,250
But only you can really
make things better.

347
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
<i>Floor Minus Five.
Decryption and Analysis.</i>

348
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:29,916
And the renovation schedule?

349
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,667
We can discuss the
cryptography project.

350
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,624
Okay. All right. I can do this.

351
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,833
Thanks. I think we
need to flag this.

352
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,667
<i>You've been very quiet lately.</i>

353
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,833
<i>Guessed where I live yet?</i>

354
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,666
You good here for
a minute, buddy?

355
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,249
I gotta close up the back.

356
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,500
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

357
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,583
I got you covered out here.

358
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,125
<i>Floor Seven. Executive.</i>

359
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,875
<i>I'm holding the highlights
of over 100 eyes-only cables.</i>

360
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:28,041
These are double coded from a
data cache out of Kabul Station.

361
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,542
These are the official cables.

362
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,207
Same dates, same events...

363
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,374
except for very
key information...

364
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:38,875
that has been altered or completely
scrubbed from the record.

365
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,125
What are you talking about?

366
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,625
This is your cover-up.

367
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,124
Have you lost your mind?

368
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,374
To put it mildly.

369
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:53,332
This is your order of operations
to destroy a hospital in Syria.

370
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,624
An allied base in Yemen.

371
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,291
An Afghani politician's house.

372
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,457
You have no idea what...

373
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,874
A border crossing in Somalia.

374
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,332
I count more than
1,000 casualties...

375
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,291
and over 400
civilian fatalities.

376
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,957
It's only out of respect
for your recent loss...

377
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,332
that I'm not throwing
you out of this office.

378
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,707
I'm just gonna tell you, you
don't have a goddamn clue.

379
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,791
You see right here?

380
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,167
The convoy?

381
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,625
You targeted our allies.

382
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:20,749
You false-flagged it.

383
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,457
You got them all fired up...

384
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,000
and then sucked them right
back in where you wanted them.

385
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,749
You were forcing mission creep.

386
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,292
Okay. That's enough.

387
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,750
"That's enough"?

388
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,375
These were not
operational choices.

389
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,375
You, sir, made
political decisions.

390
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:40,791
And your signatures
are all over these.

391
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,457
Here and here. And here.

392
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,166
-You are so far above your pay grade.
-And here.

393
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,957
Well, you're right.
You're right.

394
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,832
Maybe we should...

395
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,542
take this up with the director?

396
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,583
Let her call it?

397
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,541
Or maybe it's for the
<i>Times</i> or the <i>Post.</i>

398
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,082
You've been to the
press with this?

399
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,374
-You'll go to jail, idiot.
-Maybe.

400
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,249
But we'll all be there together.

401
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,667
We have a mission here.

402
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,500
A responsibility.

403
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,750
We'll defend our nation
by any means necessary.

404
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:16,332
I don't think Mr. Heller came here to
debate ethics and practices, right?

405
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,417
Right.

406
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,957
First, you need to know that
I've set up a dead man's switch.

407
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,707
If I don't code in
every five hours...

408
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,749
these files will
automatically be sent

409
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,041
to three top investigative
journalists...

410
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,874
along with a detailed report
and timeline of the events.

411
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,624
Twenty-four hours later, the files
will be released to the public.

412
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,791
I get it.

413
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,457
We kill you, Wolf
Blitzer wins an Emmy.

414
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,666
No. Not just kill me.

415
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,541
You put me in jail, you
black-site me, you extradite me...

416
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,207
you'll only condemn yourselves.

417
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,957
Then what the hell do you want?

418
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:48,249
He wants us to kill the
people who killed his wife.

419
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,833
No. No.

420
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,292
I don't want you to kill them.

421
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,333
I wanna kill them myself.

422
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,917
-I beg your pardon?
-You heard me.

423
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:04,250
I want to find and kill the
people who murdered my wife.

424
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:06,958
The CIA will train me.

425
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,624
I mean, this is a
practical joke, right?

426
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,916
I don't think you could
beat a 90-year-old nun

427
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,292
in an arm-wrestling match.

428
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,667
That's funny.

429
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,625
Humor?

430
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,082
I want mission-specific
training...

431
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,791
and all the information the
company has on these people.

432
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,000
Cash. And a new
identity. A legend.

433
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,583
Anything else?

434
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,375
An Aston Martin?

435
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,458
A jet pack, maybe?

436
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,958
I want a fighting chance.

437
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,499
How do we know he really set
up the dead man's switch?

438
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,666
We don't.

439
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,582
We need to keep a lid on this.

440
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,708
Right.

441
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,167
So, let's play along...

442
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,667
till we're sure.

443
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,999
What? Actually train him?

444
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,541
What harm can it do?

445
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,707
Probably quit of his own accord.

446
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,667
Meanwhile, get Park onto him.

447
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,666
I can't believe I'm doing this.

448
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:33,624
We scrub his life till
we find the switch.

449
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,124
If it exists.

450
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,707
If it doesn't...

451
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,625
well, maybe there's
a training accident.

452
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,958
Let's use Henderson.

453
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,583
{\an8}<i>Escort team, stand by for
new arrival at gate four.</i>

454
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,583
Charles Heller?

455
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,750
Charlie.

456
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,542
You're late.

457
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,416
With respect, I'm
actually about...

458
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,958
You're late.

459
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:05,917
You comin'?

460
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,750
The hell you doin'?

461
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:15,750
I'm not an Uber driver.

462
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Sorry.

463
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,333
-Okay.
-Put it over here on the left.

464
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,582
Yeah. Put those two
routers over there.

465
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,374
-I got 'em.
-The HDMI cables are in the box.

466
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,999
My bet is he's bluffing.

467
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,083
The man has an IQ of
170. Let's not assume.

468
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,374
The only way out is
through security...

469
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,958
and there's not a chance he got
past them with a digital file.

470
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,999
Then why is he standing in
blind spots for over 40 minutes?

471
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,333
Here, here, and
here. On this day.

472
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,749
And look at that sweat.

473
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,167
Yeah. That is a lot of sweat.

474
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:01,708
Are you my handler?

475
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,042
I am Colonel Henderson.

476
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,541
My friends call me Hendo.

477
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,042
You will call me
Colonel Henderson.

478
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,332
I have been asked to give
you a refresher course...

479
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,957
even though what
you'll learn here

480
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,291
is outside the
normal curriculum.

481
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:19,332
Next to God Almighty, I am the most
important person in the world...

482
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,874
to an operative looking to
target enemy combatants.

483
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,250
Do precisely as I say...

484
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,500
and there is a slight chance
you may come out of this alive.

485
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,291
Only a slight chance?

486
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:34,083
I'm overestimating your odds
to boost your confidence, son.

487
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:40,375
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give us the room.

488
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,250
Go have coffee. Now.

489
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:52,708
-Yeah, make sure you check for all spots.
-All right, checking.

490
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,958
Open all hard drive cleaners.

491
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,416
Bring the mountings too.

492
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,957
Wait. You think
he used a skimmer?

493
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,625
They don't work on these drives.

494
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,000
They work on printers.

495
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,291
<i>Six days ago, he sent the
files to the printer...</i>

496
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,375
<i>and skimmed them with
a magnetic strip...</i>

497
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,625
rewrote the software
in the printer.

498
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,085
Doesn't mean he got the
strip out of the building.

499
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:22,499
Okay. So, ANPR has his Saab at
Best Buy at 09:17 on the 13th...

500
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,332
where he bought
the magnetic strip.

501
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,416
Then got gas.

502
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,916
Copied the files at 11:03...

503
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,999
met you two the next morning.

504
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,291
If he smuggled it
out, he did it here.

505
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,332
Still, screener
picked up nothing.

506
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,583
Maybe he swallowed it.

507
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,375
Still would have picked it up.

508
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:53,833
Kind of far.

509
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:57,708
You stand right there.

510
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:07,917
Hold your fire!

511
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,207
Try it closer.

512
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,542
Just a few rounds.

513
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,666
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

514
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,208
Did we test your vision?

515
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,875
Guess I just have
to get that close.

516
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,292
Yeah, at point blank range...

517
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:47,667
you might have a 50-50
chance of hittin' something.

518
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,458
Overestimating my odds?

519
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,916
Why don't you guys check
the downstairs bathroom?

520
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,125
Pass me those boxes.

521
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,333
So, an IED consists
of an initiator...

522
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,874
switch, main charge...

523
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,291
power source, container
for enhancements.

524
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:17,374
Stuff like fertilizer, nails...

525
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,666
glass, ammonia nitrate.

526
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,624
Beauty is, you can
use what you find,

527
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,166
big or small, as you like.

528
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,167
Improvise. Design
it for your purpose.

529
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,250
Carry the components with you.

530
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,957
I'll be damned.

531
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,500
Looks like we finally found
something you do well, Heller.

532
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:40,417
May I keep this?

533
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,624
Sure.

534
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,541
He went here twice. This bar.

535
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,457
Why?

536
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,499
Once with Mr. Dominguez
on the night of the 24th.

537
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,249
Couple of weeks
after his wife died.

538
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,166
And then again, the
next month, the 13th.

539
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,707
-The day he downloaded the files.
-Right.

540
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,166
We searched it, though.

541
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,082
Let's search it again.

542
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,166
<i>-Name?
-Clark Nicholas Jenson.</i>

543
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:01,249
Spell that for me.

544
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,916
J-E-N-S-O-N.

545
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:03,832
-You sure?
-Yeah.

546
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,041
Not Jenson Clark?

547
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,332
-No!
-Fast.

548
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,457
Clark Nicholas Jenson.

549
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,499
-Where were you born?
-Raleigh. Raleigh, North Carolina.

550
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,957
-Which hospital? Now!
-Duke University Hospital.

551
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,417
-Your mother's maiden name?
-Deborah Jane Hammock.

552
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Just a sec.

553
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,916
It's all being re-swept.
Even the parking lot.

554
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,333
There's no drive here.

555
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,291
Okay. That's what
we didn't find.

556
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:32,833
But what did we find?

557
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:37,250
I don't know, this was
stuck under the jukebox.

558
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,708
Give me a quarter.

559
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,417
Pull the disc.

560
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,667
You...

561
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:09,625
are not a killer.

562
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:12,792
No?

563
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,625
-Hey, who's this?
-Leave them.

564
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,458
These the assholes that
killed your wife, huh?

565
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,999
So, how do you plan
to take them all out?

566
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,332
The first one you kill,

567
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,749
you let the other ones
know you're coming.

568
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,333
And then what? What's your plan?

569
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,042
How are you gonna keep the
people at Langley off your ass?

570
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,375
That's what I need
you to teach me.

571
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,125
All right. I'll teach you.

572
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,499
Take it.

573
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,499
-Come on.
-Go on, take it.

574
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,416
What is it? What are you...

575
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,875
-Take it! Now!
-Hey!

576
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,083
Point it at my chest.

577
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,416
-Point it at my chest!
-You think that...

578
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:50,832
-Do it now!
-All right, all right.

579
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,417
Put your finger on the trigger!

580
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:55,999
Come on.

581
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,083
Look at me.

582
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,375
Come on.

583
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,917
Come on, Charlie.

584
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,125
Paralyzing, isn't it?

585
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,917
Pointing a live weapon
at someone like that.

586
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,999
You have to either be very
confident or very stupid...

587
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,208
which is its own
kind of confidence.

588
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,457
Truth is you don't have
that kinda confidence.

589
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:33,374
And you are not stupid.
Not in the slightest.

590
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,042
You're just not a
killer, Charlie.

591
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,833
People have certain gifts.

592
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:42,042
You can't do what I do, no
matter how much I train you...

593
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,874
as much as you can't teach
me how to break code.

594
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,167
I can't make you into
somethin' that you're not.

595
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm sorry.

596
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,458
When the time comes...

597
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,082
I'll pull the trigger.

598
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,708
When the time comes...

599
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,208
you won't even remember which end
of the gun the bullet comes out of.

600
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:10,875
How long is this gonna take?

601
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:14,750
With this encryption,
four or five hours.

602
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,207
<i>What if she can't break
Heller's encryption?</i>

603
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,333
<i>She will.</i>

604
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,375
<i>How do we know he
didn't make 50 copies?</i>

605
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:28,042
<i>We don't.</i>

606
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,041
Ali.

607
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,249
<i>We're in.</i>

608
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,542
It's a bluff.

609
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,124
He was playing us.

610
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,875
And he did pretty well, too.

611
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,167
Take him off the board?

612
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,458
Yeah.

613
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,458
Okay.

614
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:19,249
He's gone?

615
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,749
<i>He's got a bag full
of passports...</i>

616
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,541
even hacked the biometrics.

617
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,124
Yeah, he got out on
a janitor's card.

618
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,250
<i>This is a joke.</i>

619
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,874
Maybe y'all misjudged
this individual.

620
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:28,875
<i>You think?</i>

621
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,292
He knew exactly
what he was doin'.

622
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,542
Kept us chasin' breadcrumbs
just long enough...

623
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,750
while he got himself
some training.

624
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,333
Mr. Heller...

625
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,375
<i>bugging a CIA officer...</i>

626
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,333
<i>is treason.</i>

627
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:39,582
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard
American Airlines flight AA143...</i>

628
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,875
<i>with service from Washington
Dulles to London Heathrow.</i>

629
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,832
<i>We thank you for your attention
whilst we demonstrate...</i>

630
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,667
<i>the safety features
of the aircraft.</i>

631
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,416
Yes?

632
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:56,375
Okay, you can open them.

633
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,500
Happy birthday.

634
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,082
Did it crash?

635
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:13,207
Apparently it wasn't tied down
properly and got thrown around...

636
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,042
in a tornado or
hurricane or something.

637
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,792
<i>What do you think?</i>

638
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,167
<i>I have no words.</i>

639
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,541
{\an8}<i>-Yeah?
-Yeah.</i>

640
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,083
{\an8}<i>It's not crazy?</i>

641
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,208
<i>It needs some work.</i>

642
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:34,667
<i>You think?</i>

643
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,583
<i>This...</i>

644
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:43,875
This is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

645
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,291
Yeah?

646
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,625
Yeah.

647
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,958
<i>Second most.</i>

648
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,542
Happy birthday.

649
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,333
<i>...Paris will be departing
now from platform two.</i>

650
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,207
He's in London.

651
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:17,207
One of his passports just lit up
at immigration on his way to Paris.

652
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,457
-I'll grab local liaison.
-No.

653
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,000
This stays with us.

654
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,875
What about Henderson?

655
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,250
Call him.

656
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,416
<i>Hey, there, lockpick fans.</i>

657
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:43,624
<i>Okay. Today we're gonna pick
an apartment-style lock.</i>

658
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,374
<i>So, the first thing
we're gonna do</i>

659
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,874
<i>is you're gonna take
your tension wrench...</i>

660
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:50,291
<i>and you're gonna stick it in the
bottom of the keyhole and the plug...</i>

661
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,125
<i>just like so. Feel it?</i>

662
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:56,249
<i>You're gonna apply just a little
bit of pressure, just a little bit.</i>

663
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,624
<i>Hey, you don't want too much.</i>

664
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,999
<i>Too much and what's gonna happen is
the pins are gonna bind up on you...</i>

665
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,249
<i>and you won't be able to
get 'em up on a shear line.</i>

666
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,874
<i>And you're not gonna
get into that door.</i>

667
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,541
<i>So, gently, gently...</i>

668
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:13,582
<i>and feel it rotate back and
forwards, listening carefully.</i>

669
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,207
<i>Just a light touch.</i>

670
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:18,124
<i>All the pins are gonna line up.</i>

671
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:21,374
<i>And then, you're
in. There you go.</i>

672
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:22,666
<i>How to pick a lock.</i>

673
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:23,833
<i>Pretty darn easy.</i>

674
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,249
<i>Yeah, don't forget to
like and subscribe.</i>

675
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,625
<i>Thank y'all. See you next week.</i>

676
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,750
Yes.

677
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:45,457
-Sunflowers.
-Yeah.

678
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:46,458
Excuse me.

679
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:48,833
All of them, please.

680
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,417
The lilies as well, please.

681
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:54,583
I'll get all of them.

682
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,458
You must have done
something really bad.

683
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,833
Not yet.

684
00:53:58,833 --> 00:53:59,958
It's pollen.

685
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,166
Who are you?

686
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,832
Tell me where Horst Schiller
is and I'll let you out.

687
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,667
Screw you.

688
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:10,208
No.

689
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,042
No, no, no, no.

690
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,958
No, no, no. That's
not gonna work.

691
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,332
Open the door.

692
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,416
I'm sorry. Not
until you tell me.

693
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:28,417
Please, just tell
me where he is.

694
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:30,125
Why?

695
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:32,458
Because you killed my wife.

696
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,958
Her name was Sarah.

697
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,458
Tell me where he is.

698
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:39,583
Tell me!

699
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:41,374
Tell me!

700
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:42,916
I don't... I don't know.

701
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:44,000
He contacts...

702
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:46,832
He contacts us.

703
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:47,917
Messenger...

704
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,667
I can't hear you.

705
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,208
I can't hear you.

706
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,167
Shit!

707
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:54,542
Shit.

708
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:00,875
Hello.

709
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:03,833
37 euros, please, sir.

710
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,500
What do we know
about Gretchen Frank?

711
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:58,542
Our people say one of her
own folks ran her down.

712
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:02,583
Most likely fallout from when
the London job went south.

713
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:04,916
I'll let State know.

714
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:06,249
French ambassador is asking.

715
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,375
Wasn't us.

716
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:29,042
You want a beer?

717
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:32,875
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

718
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,291
How did you find me?

719
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:43,958
Phone you pulled
off Gretchen Frank.

720
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:46,333
-It's like a radar ping.
-Shit.

721
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:48,749
Doesn't matter
how smart you are.

722
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,708
If you panic, that will
always screw up a good plan.

723
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,583
Then there's the
survival instinct.

724
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,583
No one goes down easy.

725
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,249
And, of course, the aftermath...

726
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,583
when you realize you've done
something you can't undo, ever.

727
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,750
I can live with that.

728
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,083
You can't.

729
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,374
You surprised me, Charlie.

730
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:22,457
I can't tell you
how rare that is.

731
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,667
But it ends here.

732
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,750
There are no three-volley
salutes in this work.

733
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:33,041
We're the John Does that get found
in the dumpster, if we get found.

734
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,125
Which you won't.

735
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,042
I'm sorry.

736
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:44,708
No, those were good lessons.

737
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:48,917
You're a good teacher, Hendo.

738
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,750
I took that into account.

739
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:56,417
Fifty-fifty odds, right?

740
01:02:57,792 --> 01:03:01,167
Did you ever account for
the things I was good at?

741
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,042
Base charge on a timer.

742
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,708
<i>You have one new message.</i>

743
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:16,582
<i>Meet Ottoman Cargo.</i>

744
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,082
<i>Hangar seven. They're
expecting you.</i>

745
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,625
<i>You'll need 500 euros in cash.</i>

746
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:37,625
<i>You have one new message.</i>

747
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,625
<i>The Fahri Cafe,
Kuveloğlu Street.</i>

748
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,875
<i>I will pass you a book.</i>

749
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,458
Wait. He is not who
you're looking for.

750
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:43,542
Check your phone.

751
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:07,458
It was reckless of you to come
here, whatever your reasons.

752
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:09,832
Listen, I need your help.

753
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,249
No. You have nowhere else to go.

754
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,833
That's not the same thing.

755
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,042
We're shopping, okay?

756
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:18,667
Give me your backpack.

757
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,917
And your hat.

758
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:30,625
Now you look less American.

759
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,500
What do you want?

760
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:36,832
My wife was murdered.

761
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,292
I know about your wife.

762
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,792
And Paris, that was you?

763
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,832
I need to find the others.

764
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:46,917
No. Not here.

765
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:51,124
There is a parking garage four
blocks from here, that way.

766
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,624
First floor.

767
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,916
Do some shopping, then meet
me there in half an hour.

768
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:57,125
And if you're not
followed, we'll talk more.

769
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,833
So, how long has it been you?

770
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:24,833
Six years.

771
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,832
My husband was a CIA asset.

772
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,416
Former KGB.

773
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:31,458
He was Inquiline until he died.

774
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:34,625
He fell out of a window.

775
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,124
I'm sorry.

776
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,541
Accidental falls from windows

777
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:41,124
are the number-one cause
of death of former KGB.

778
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,250
You didn't know?

779
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,791
He taught me everything
he was doing...

780
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:48,708
how to mine data
cache, encrypt files.

781
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,333
And after he died...

782
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:54,457
well, I decided to keep up my
connection to your department...

783
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,000
in case I needed help.

784
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:59,791
Which is why I always thought
you were a middle-aged man.

785
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:01,708
Because you were, to begin with.

786
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,666
You aren't exactly what
I pictured, either.

787
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,416
How did you picture me?

788
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,417
I don't know.

789
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,417
Mr. CIA-man-with-a-gun, I guess.

790
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:15,917
So, you'll help me?

791
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:43,750
It's better than
any alarm system.

792
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,456
This is the first place I've
stayed in for more than a month...

793
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:53,917
in the last three years.

794
01:08:56,082 --> 01:08:57,332
I don't sleep.

795
01:08:58,082 --> 01:09:00,750
But I just don't
want to run anymore.

796
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:05,500
What makes you think
they won't find you here?

797
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,082
For that night...

798
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:11,499
when they do.

799
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,581
You really think you're gonna
fight off the Russians with that?

800
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:15,831
It's not for them.

801
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:17,082
It's for me.

802
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:22,749
Those are the three, correct?

803
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,791
Yeah.

804
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,956
Schiller seems to
be the coordinator.

805
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:27,541
Ringleader.

806
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,917
But he's also the most
difficult to profile.

807
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:33,956
As far as I can tell, they operate as
middlemen in the proliferation chain.

808
01:09:33,957 --> 01:09:35,624
And just like the
data you showed me...

809
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:39,041
{\an8}they also source mercenaries
for Director Moore's black ops.

810
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:42,581
Ellish sources the weapons,
but he's beyond paranoid.

811
01:09:42,582 --> 01:09:45,207
So, we have to find a way
to pull him out of the dark.

812
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,416
Okay. Perhaps I can
start the conversation.

813
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,417
Suggest I have a
contract for him.

814
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,167
See if he will engage.

815
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:54,917
Okay. And this is
Mishka Blazhic.

816
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:58,541
He seems to be based in Moscow,
but he likes to keep on the move.

817
01:09:58,542 --> 01:10:02,125
Enjoys his luxuries. Travels
everywhere first class.

818
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:03,832
He may be the weak link.

819
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,375
Even posts online.

820
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:06,999
This was just last week.

821
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,624
No location, but the
vineyard on level ground...

822
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:14,832
and the spacing is wider than
typical, so probably hotter climate.

823
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,957
Chalky soil. Maybe granite.

824
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,666
Low sun hitting the
wine in his glass.

825
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:21,375
But the vineyard would
be angled north-south...

826
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,167
so it's sunrise.

827
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:27,041
And this church. The
architecture looks Spanish.

828
01:10:27,042 --> 01:10:28,249
So, hot in October.

829
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,958
Maybe central Spain.

830
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,750
And here, in the reflection...

831
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,458
girlfriend, maybe.

832
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:40,250
And there she is.

833
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,458
Alexandra Solovoya,

834
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,624
who also likes to travel.

835
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:48,708
And she flew Moscow
to Madrid, last week.

836
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,207
<i>We need to project everything
that makes America great...</i>

837
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,082
<i>but we need to do it openly...</i>

838
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,292
<i>-and transparently.</i>
-We have to assume he's still alive.

839
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,499
He has three targets.

840
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,541
<i>And so, I pledge...</i>

841
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:02,249
We need to locate and
get eyes on all of them.

842
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:05,916
<i>...this agency will be
worthy of the nation's trust.</i>

843
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:09,750
{\an8}<i>Within our country and beyond,
we will be accountable.</i>

844
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:11,832
I saw your speech.

845
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:12,917
It was excellent.

846
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:17,000
You know, you're the first person
my predecessor briefed me on?

847
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:20,416
About the stick up
your ass on ISIS, AQ...

848
01:11:20,417 --> 01:11:22,042
Iran, counterterrorism?

849
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:26,457
Even now, three years after
mandatory retirement...

850
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,958
they keep looking the other way.

851
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:31,125
But it's housekeeping time...

852
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,417
and I need to know
where you stand.

853
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:37,457
Sounds like you're suggesting
it's time for me to go private.

854
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:40,250
Write a neat book about
my time with the company.

855
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:44,250
Yet here we are, enjoying
this lovely meal.

856
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:46,457
So, why?

857
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:47,667
Oh, please.

858
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,875
I'm new, but I'm not stupid.

859
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:52,833
I need you to be accountable.

860
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,583
To me.

861
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:57,708
Stop playing your
black ops in the sand.

862
01:11:58,042 --> 01:12:00,124
I need to be across everything.

863
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,958
And I mean everything.

864
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,583
Hey, Brian?

865
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:12,166
Can you bring me another one of
these sourdough roll thingies?

866
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:13,167
Sure, Mr. Moore.

867
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,042
I'll tell you a story.

868
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:22,207
Your predecessor sat me down
at this very same table...

869
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,749
no more than a week
into his term...

870
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:28,417
and gave me pretty much
this exact same speech.

871
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:30,583
Oh, wait.

872
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,374
Maybe it was his predecessor.

873
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,832
I can't remember.

874
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:37,833
Anyway, I'll tell
you what I told them.

875
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,417
You have my full support.

876
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:45,167
Good.

877
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:47,417
Good talk.

878
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:51,958
Enjoy that pasta.

879
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,749
Where?

880
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,833
Madrid.

881
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:04,249
On whose orders?

882
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,458
Your lunch date.

883
01:13:10,292 --> 01:13:12,000
Let's get someone
of our own in play.

884
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,999
Found him.

885
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,666
At the Aguilar Hotel.

886
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:26,208
Five stars. Nightclub.
Rooftop pool.

887
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:30,958
What?

888
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,458
Langley will be onto him, too.

889
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:36,125
Well, then we keep
tracking him...

890
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:37,875
until we have a clear field.

891
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,332
No.

892
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,792
I'm going.

893
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Okay.

894
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:51,667
And keep an eye out for him.

895
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,500
This is who they'll send.

896
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:12,374
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

897
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:14,083
Nobody walks home. We roll home.

898
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,458
He's a night swimmer.

899
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,958
<i>He pays the staff to
clear the rooftop for him.</i>

900
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,249
<i>...the approval of the team...</i>

901
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,207
<i>and the ambitious plans
were given the green light.</i>

902
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:49,750
<i>The sky pool is suspended 16 stories
above the ground which is 70 meters.</i>

903
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:54,457
<i>The thickness of the clear glass
will be 420 centimeters in total...</i>

904
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:57,666
<i>made of three panels with air
gaps to improve the strength.</i>

905
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,999
<i>The pool will be three meters
tall, five meters wide...</i>

906
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,250
<i>and can hold an impressive
150 tons of water.</i>

907
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,208
<i>You could shoot him from there.</i>

908
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:10,792
You haven't seen me shoot.

909
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:15,832
Not for me to say here,
boss, but why bury him?

910
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:16,874
Why not just roll him up?

911
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:19,207
We're past that.
Too big of a stench.

912
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:22,124
Look, he practically invented
half of our surveillance tech.

913
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,458
Now, I will find him...

914
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,541
but you might have a
bigger stench on your hands

915
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:26,874
if he gives us the slip again.

916
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:28,625
You won't let that happen.

917
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,917
Charlie Heller.

918
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:51,917
Okay. You're going to
have to clue me in.

919
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,166
Integrity.

920
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:54,666
It's all about integrity.

921
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:56,749
To have morals,
something like that?

922
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,333
<i>Yeah. And something
else as well.</i>

923
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:00,375
If I have the math right.

924
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:01,958
I should move.

925
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,258
Can I confirm the pool
will be ready as usual?

926
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:48,875
Over here.

927
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:59,167
Second stool down at the bar.

928
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:01,249
Yeah. What about him?

929
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,374
<i>He's been following me.</i>

930
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:04,041
<i>I've clocked him three times.</i>

931
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:06,042
Yeah, well, where there's
one, there's always more.

932
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,582
Shit.

933
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:12,625
You're right.

934
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,166
{\an8}Yeah, I've got your man.

935
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:17,125
{\an8}He's in the lobby, moving
across towards the elevators.

936
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,792
<i>And the man at the bar,
I have an ID on him.</i>

937
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,542
Charlie, he's also CIA.

938
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,625
<i>You have to leave now.</i>

939
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,083
<i>Heller, are you listening to me?</i>

940
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,333
No. No, we go as planned.

941
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:56,166
I'm allowed to use the pool.

942
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:57,917
I paid for it.

943
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,542
Is there a problem?

944
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,917
Tell me where to
find Horst Schiller.

945
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:07,708
Who are you?

946
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,791
You held a gun to
my wife's head.

947
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:11,958
She was terrified.

948
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,374
-You have the wrong guy.
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

949
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,166
You didn't pull the trigger.

950
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:19,292
So, tell me where to find him.

951
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,666
If this is a joke,
I don't get it.

952
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:23,042
It's not a joke.

953
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:25,249
This is a remote that
controls a device...

954
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:28,874
that's been decompressing the air
between the sheets of glass beneath you.

955
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,749
If I trigger it, the
glass will shatter.

956
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,417
So, tell me where he is...

957
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,707
or swim very fast.

958
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:37,500
You have the wrong person.

959
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:38,958
No.

960
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:43,708
I have exactly the right person.

961
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,083
Charlie, you should
get out of there.

962
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:15,042
Shit.

963
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,874
<i>Henderson's headed your way.</i>

964
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:18,167
Go towards the stairwell.

965
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,082
Where is he now?

966
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,166
He's in the stairwell.
Three floors above.

967
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:29,207
Head towards the basement.

968
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:30,750
<i>There's an exit in the back.</i>

969
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,874
Shit! There's another one...

970
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:45,541
already in the basement.

971
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:46,833
<i>He's coming towards you.</i>

972
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,124
Which way? Which way?

973
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,500
Left. Go left.

974
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:56,083
<i>Where is he? The other one?</i>

975
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,065
I don't know. I'm
looking right now.

976
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,417
Heller, stop!

977
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:02,708
Stop! Stop.

978
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:25,582
<i>Charlie, you gotta
get out of there.</i>

979
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:26,958
You've got to go.

980
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:28,292
<i>Right now.</i>

981
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:42,457
You wanted to see me?

982
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:43,708
Have a seat.

983
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:49,875
Where's Charlie Heller?

984
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,667
As far as I know, still
on bereavement leave.

985
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:55,582
You talk to him at all?

986
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:58,083
We thought it best to give
him some space for now.

987
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,417
Makes sense.

988
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,667
I'll let you know
if we hear from him.

989
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:24,750
There.

990
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:28,332
-See that?
-Yeah. What's he doing?

991
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:29,333
His lips are moving.

992
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,625
Look in his ear.

993
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:32,832
He's talking to somebody.

994
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:33,917
Who?

995
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:38,666
Hotel security was
hacked yesterday.

996
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:39,957
Right. Time?

997
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:42,374
11:07. It was a pro job.

998
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,624
The origination
is murky at best.

999
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:45,750
Istanbul, perhaps.

1000
01:22:46,042 --> 01:22:47,042
Talk to me.

1001
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:48,375
From Heller.

1002
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:52,624
"If I had to guess, you're
a 50-year-old Russian man...

1003
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:54,958
living in Istanbul."

1004
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,042
"Inquiline."

1005
01:22:57,542 --> 01:22:58,958
Code name "Inquiline."

1006
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,417
Locate this person.

1007
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:17,375
How are you feeling?

1008
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,208
I don't know. I didn't
screw up so much this time.

1009
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,500
Not so sure that's
a good thing, right?

1010
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,875
Actually, I meant
feeding the birds.

1011
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,500
When my husband was murdered...

1012
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:40,208
I wasn't prepared for how
quiet the world would become.

1013
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:44,667
All the sounds that a
person makes in your life.

1014
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,375
The rhythms.

1015
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:51,292
How you expect a certain sound
at a certain time of day.

1016
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:54,500
The door, footfall.

1017
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:58,542
The stupid thing he used
to do that annoyed me.

1018
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,000
And then suddenly there's...

1019
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,708
nothing.

1020
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:09,083
It's just great...

1021
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:10,958
silence.

1022
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:14,625
For me...

1023
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,332
every moment since
has been about...

1024
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:19,417
trying to fill that silence.

1025
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:24,042
You need to ask yourself...

1026
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,500
Doing all this...

1027
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:30,833
is it how you should fill yours?

1028
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,250
{\an8}Code name, Inquiline.

1029
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:46,332
Ex-FSB by way of the KGB.

1030
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,332
Flipped to us in '04.

1031
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,791
-Deceased in '17.
-Deceased?

1032
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:54,208
The Russians suspect his widow
may be operating in his place.

1033
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,708
Get me the Russian
station chief in Istanbul.

1034
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:22,542
What's wrong?

1035
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:26,375
I want nothing from you.

1036
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:32,250
I just want to sleep for one night
with another person beside me.

1037
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:37,042
Okay.

1038
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,083
Shit.

1039
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:23,832
-Move.
-Shit.

1040
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:25,208
Go. Move, move.

1041
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,333
This way. This way. Come on.

1042
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:35,667
Come on. Come on.

1043
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,125
Hey.

1044
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:06,250
Have they gone?

1045
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:09,582
It's okay. It's okay.

1046
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,792
We're okay. We've lost them.

1047
01:28:12,917 --> 01:28:14,833
We're okay, we're
okay, we're okay.

1048
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:24,333
Shit.

1049
01:28:30,042 --> 01:28:31,042
You're okay.

1050
01:28:32,542 --> 01:28:33,750
Shit.

1051
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:44,833
Shit.

1052
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Shit.

1053
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:55,833
Oh, God.

1054
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,208
{\an8}-Heller's in Berlin.
-What?

1055
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,292
This was 40 minutes ago.

1056
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:19,875
Yeah?

1057
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,500
<i>Put the money on
the chair. Count it.</i>

1058
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:26,707
Nothing until I
inspect the hardware.

1059
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,750
<i>Hardware's right
there. Go ahead.</i>

1060
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:31,042
<i>Stay on the phone.</i>

1061
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:34,124
Shit.

1062
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:36,541
<i>You just armed an IED.
It's on a beam trigger.</i>

1063
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:40,875
<i>You drop the lid, move away, or
cross the beam, it detonates.</i>

1064
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,541
Who the hell are you?

1065
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:46,041
Do you honestly think
I came here alone?

1066
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:47,749
<i>Look at the photograph.</i>

1067
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,000
<i>See it?</i>

1068
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,124
<i>Do you see it?</i>

1069
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:53,166
Yeah, sure. I see
the photograph.

1070
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,417
<i>Do you recognize her?</i>

1071
01:32:56,375 --> 01:32:58,000
<i>London, maybe?</i>

1072
01:32:58,833 --> 01:32:59,791
That's Sarah.

1073
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:01,083
You took her life.

1074
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,042
For no reason.

1075
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,667
Wasn't me, okay?

1076
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:08,999
I didn't shoot her.

1077
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:09,957
Fine.

1078
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:13,082
Just tell me what I need to know,
and I'll deactivate the device.

1079
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:14,374
All right. Okay.
Come on, come on.

1080
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,124
Where is he?
Schiller. Where is he?

1081
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:17,166
It's impossible, man.

1082
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:19,749
After what happened to Gretchen
and Blazhic, he's gone.

1083
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,041
Horst's gone.

1084
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:23,249
Well, then you are
of no use to me...

1085
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,890
-are you?
-No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait!

1086
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,375
He'll be at sea, right?
He stays on his boat.

1087
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:32,374
-Which sea?
-I don't know. Russian waters.

1088
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:35,499
That's 25,000
miles of coastline.

1089
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,916
-Which sea?
-I don't know! Russian waters!

1090
01:33:37,917 --> 01:33:39,707
Not good enough. Too vague.

1091
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:40,999
Oh, come on, man!

1092
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,957
You supply him with this
shit, right? These missiles.

1093
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:45,666
-Correct?
-Yeah.

1094
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:47,583
Yeah? So where do
you deliver them?

1095
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:52,332
A port on the Baltic Primorsk.

1096
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:54,250
It's there. Okay, there's a...

1097
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:57,958
There's a café.

1098
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:02,041
He calls in there,
and that's it.

1099
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:03,458
How do you contact him?

1100
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:07,207
He uses two numbers for his men.

1101
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:09,124
If they get the right
codes, they know it's me.

1102
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:10,874
That's all I have.

1103
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:11,999
We'll see.

1104
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,167
Give me your phone.

1105
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:14,667
Your phone.

1106
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,582
The numbers are there.

1107
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:25,042
The codes are by their names.

1108
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:32,666
Their names?

1109
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,832
Simon and Kristoff.

1110
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:37,667
I'm not messing, man. Simon
and Kristoff. Come on.

1111
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:40,207
-There. You see? See, I'm not...
-You're right.

1112
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:42,917
I'm not lying. Now,
deactivate this thing.

1113
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,875
Hey, where are you going?

1114
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:48,666
Where you going?

1115
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:51,041
If you jump really fast,
you might survive the blast.

1116
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:52,125
Please!

1117
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:53,917
Wait!

1118
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:55,958
Wait!

1119
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:04,999
We got a ping in Rome.

1120
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,624
The little prick
is now at a museum?

1121
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:08,958
He's not in Rome.

1122
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:10,917
We're chasing vapors.

1123
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:12,624
How?

1124
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:15,499
Because they're shoveling what's
left of Mister Lawrence Ellish...

1125
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,457
out of the mud in Romania.

1126
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:19,000
He just got on a tram in Prague.

1127
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,542
You need to sleep again.

1128
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:24,500
Are you kidding me?

1129
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,249
What do you think, man?

1130
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,582
Just coincidence or what?

1131
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,167
Yeah, somehow, I doubt that.

1132
01:38:30,792 --> 01:38:32,124
What do you say, maybe...

1133
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:34,957
let's go get us a cup of
shitty Russian coffee, huh?

1134
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:36,374
Come on.

1135
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:37,791
Look at you in
the big, bad city.

1136
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:39,167
Come on, let's go.

1137
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:41,875
So, a rabbit on the run, huh?

1138
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,125
Sit down, man.

1139
01:38:58,083 --> 01:38:59,832
So, you're here to kill me?

1140
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:02,041
Nah, that's not
really what I do.

1141
01:39:02,042 --> 01:39:05,041
I mean, I might set you up to get
killed. You know, facilitate it.

1142
01:39:05,042 --> 01:39:06,542
What are you looking for?

1143
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:09,999
I don't know, my assassin?

1144
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,874
Your assassin? Yeah,
and what do you think?

1145
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,124
What does an assassin look like?

1146
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,582
I mean, it can kinda
be anyone, huh?

1147
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:20,208
I mean, even a slight little nerdy
fella likes to work on computers.

1148
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:21,999
Only thing dangerous
about him is...

1149
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,707
he's got this dream about
rehabbing a Cessna...

1150
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:28,167
just to fly it around to prove
to himself that he's not afraid.

1151
01:39:33,917 --> 01:39:35,250
These are killer, by the way.

1152
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:38,493
I'm gonna show you something.

1153
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,375
I gotta hand it to you. I
almost didn't recognize you.

1154
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,541
I said to the team, "Nah,
there's no way. That ain't him."

1155
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:48,582
What do you want?

1156
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:50,083
Honestly...

1157
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:52,625
just here to save your life.

1158
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,249
How are you gonna do that?

1159
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,708
Chuck, you killed three people.

1160
01:39:58,208 --> 01:40:00,624
Are you done? Have
you had enough?

1161
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,499
No. I want the guy who pulled
the trigger. I want 'em all.

1162
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,874
Damn, dude.

1163
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,874
Well, that's pretty
cold-blooded.

1164
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,374
You think they're gonna
let you leave Russia?

1165
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:10,291
I mean, how does that even
work? How do you leave here?

1166
01:40:10,292 --> 01:40:11,791
The only way you leave
here is in a box.

1167
01:40:11,792 --> 01:40:15,874
But if you walk out of here right
now with me, I can help you.

1168
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,833
Nobody sent me.
I'm here on my own.

1169
01:40:18,958 --> 01:40:20,541
Shit, maybe you got a
future in this field.

1170
01:40:20,542 --> 01:40:22,374
Maybe we can figure
something out like that, huh?

1171
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:23,582
Just come home with me.

1172
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:25,042
I have a future in the field?

1173
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:29,292
Well, I could have sworn you
just said I have no future.

1174
01:40:30,292 --> 01:40:32,957
Look, I'm not gonna sit here and pretend
like I understand what's goin' on with you.

1175
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,624
I don't, okay? I've
never felt that.

1176
01:40:34,625 --> 01:40:36,167
Your loss, I get it.

1177
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:38,707
But you honored her.

1178
01:40:38,708 --> 01:40:39,791
What do you think she wants?

1179
01:40:39,792 --> 01:40:42,958
You think she wants you to die here
in this country with these people?

1180
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:45,167
She would want you home, man.

1181
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:47,667
No.

1182
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:49,500
I can't go home.

1183
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:51,917
Why?

1184
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:55,708
She's not there.

1185
01:41:03,042 --> 01:41:04,125
Okay.

1186
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,375
You keep your head on a
swivel now, okay, Chuck?

1187
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:16,541
Sir, I'm sorry.

1188
01:42:16,542 --> 01:42:17,958
Do you speak English?

1189
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,541
Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

1190
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:23,125
There were two men.

1191
01:42:24,042 --> 01:42:26,208
With you on a truck.

1192
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:34,041
It's not very impressive, is it?

1193
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:36,958
Placed near the cargo you
have below those hatches?

1194
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:40,833
I think I might even
feel a little insulted.

1195
01:44:42,958 --> 01:44:44,875
-Who's coming after me?
-Me.

1196
01:44:45,542 --> 01:44:47,167
Me. I'm coming after you.

1197
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:50,000
And who is running you?

1198
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:54,416
What, are you afraid Director Moore
has finally decided to call it quits?

1199
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:55,833
Have you shut down?

1200
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:58,332
Whatever you think you know...

1201
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:00,999
I know Moore and Caleb
hire you and your outfit...

1202
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,667
to carry out black ops
for them. I have proof.

1203
01:45:04,167 --> 01:45:09,292
But... that's not what
this is about, is it?

1204
01:45:10,667 --> 01:45:11,667
No.

1205
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,000
I came here to face
my wife's killer.

1206
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,875
To look him in the eyes.

1207
01:45:22,042 --> 01:45:24,333
And tell him she mattered.

1208
01:45:26,542 --> 01:45:28,167
Sarah mattered.

1209
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:31,583
So, it is just you.

1210
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:37,666
Gretchen, Blazhic, Ellish...

1211
01:45:37,667 --> 01:45:40,249
the men that they
sent after you.

1212
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:43,582
This whole thing is
all your revenge?

1213
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:44,917
Charlie's revenge?

1214
01:45:50,458 --> 01:45:51,542
Please.

1215
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,167
I remember your wife.

1216
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,333
She took the place
of someone else.

1217
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:11,375
It's very, very brave.

1218
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,042
I am sorry she died.

1219
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:17,082
But it was...

1220
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:18,167
necessary.

1221
01:46:18,667 --> 01:46:20,750
The police had blocked our exit.

1222
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:27,500
I had to demonstrate what would happen
if they did not allow us to leave.

1223
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,375
That's it?

1224
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:33,375
"Necessary"?

1225
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:36,874
You are not so
different to me...

1226
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:41,000
killing these people to
find your way here to me.

1227
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,000
Has it made you feel better?

1228
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:47,000
I won't know till
I've killed you.

1229
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:51,875
It was...

1230
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:55,416
-an instant. Your wife.
-No, it wasn't.

1231
01:46:55,417 --> 01:46:57,291
Yet you tortured
my colleagues...

1232
01:46:57,292 --> 01:46:59,791
dropped a man 16 stories...

1233
01:46:59,792 --> 01:47:03,332
suffocated a woman
in a locked chamber.

1234
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:05,874
You had them all
unarmed, defenseless.

1235
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:10,374
Staged your elaborate
murders from a distance.

1236
01:47:10,375 --> 01:47:12,125
And you know why?

1237
01:47:15,042 --> 01:47:16,208
I do.

1238
01:47:17,583 --> 01:47:21,625
Because it's hard to
take a life up close.

1239
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:26,750
You lose something each time.

1240
01:47:27,125 --> 01:47:30,292
A piece of yourself you
cannot get back ever.

1241
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:35,541
And you've lost so much already.

1242
01:47:35,542 --> 01:47:39,374
So, you had to give them a chance
to escape the mouse trap...

1243
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:42,417
to run just fast enough.

1244
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:48,666
Because then you can tell yourself
there's no blood on your hands.

1245
01:47:48,667 --> 01:47:52,041
But doesn't mean you're weak.

1246
01:47:52,042 --> 01:47:56,292
Just means you are
not truly a killer.

1247
01:47:59,417 --> 01:48:00,833
Don't believe me?

1248
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:16,083
Go ahead.

1249
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:19,917
You're here to kill me.
Take it. You'll see.

1250
01:48:21,792 --> 01:48:23,750
It's not a trick. Here.

1251
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,083
All right, then.

1252
01:48:30,792 --> 01:48:32,667
End it face to face.

1253
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:40,000
A friend of mine once told me I'd
never be able to pull the trigger.

1254
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:46,000
But he also said I'd
never be able to kill.

1255
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:28,208
There it is.

1256
01:49:31,375 --> 01:49:33,083
That's what I came here for.

1257
01:49:34,792 --> 01:49:36,875
To balance the scales.

1258
01:49:40,042 --> 01:49:43,750
To make you feel what
she felt in that moment.

1259
01:49:45,125 --> 01:49:46,833
Before you killed her.

1260
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:26,708
I've taken us on a detour.

1261
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,374
Bullshit.

1262
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,708
I've taken control of your boat.

1263
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,125
We've just reached
Finnish waters.

1264
01:50:36,875 --> 01:50:38,542
That is not possible.

1265
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:41,249
This ship is a vault.

1266
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:43,499
Your own CIA insisted upon it.

1267
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,417
Using encryption I wrote.

1268
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:48,041
Look, it's all running
from my hotel room.

1269
01:50:48,042 --> 01:50:51,750
These two may have smashed my
phone, but they held on to theirs...

1270
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:53,416
and my watch.

1271
01:50:53,417 --> 01:50:56,167
So, I'm the
transmitter and you...

1272
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:58,292
you invited me in.

1273
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:02,167
I just needed you to talk as
long as it took to get us here.

1274
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,833
That would be the Finnish
Navy and Interpol.

1275
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:10,708
I gave them this location.

1276
01:51:14,083 --> 01:51:16,291
<i>We are boarding your boat.</i>

1277
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:20,083
<i>We are acting in accordance
with international law.</i>

1278
01:51:20,792 --> 01:51:23,458
<i>You are being
placed under arrest.</i>

1279
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:29,917
Stand down, stand down!

1280
01:51:31,417 --> 01:51:32,583
Down.

1281
01:51:34,917 --> 01:51:35,832
Heller.

1282
01:51:35,833 --> 01:51:37,125
Charlie Heller.

1283
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:49,250
When I took up this role...

1284
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:53,207
I made it clear to everyone
who works in this building...

1285
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:58,041
that even though our work sometimes
goes on in dark corners...

1286
01:52:58,042 --> 01:52:59,499
that is no excuse...

1287
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:03,958
to allow darkness to obscure
our objectives or our methods.

1288
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:10,207
<i>So, I'm deeply saddened to have to tell
you that information has surfaced...</i>

1289
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:15,125
<i>that implicates senior members of this
agency in carrying out rogue missions...</i>

1290
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:20,582
<i>which put the safety of our own operators
and agents we work with at great risk.</i>

1291
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:21,750
Gentlemen.

1292
01:53:22,167 --> 01:53:25,292
<i>The cost of winning the
war cannot be our honor.</i>

1293
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:28,042
Those operations
were not sanctioned.

1294
01:53:28,792 --> 01:53:30,625
They were illegal.

1295
01:53:30,958 --> 01:53:33,708
{\an8}<i>And those individuals will
face the full force of the law.</i>

1296
01:53:34,917 --> 01:53:36,417
<i>I will now take questions.</i>

1297
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:37,833
Washington Post.

1298
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:39,749
<i>I understand these
arrests are linked to...</i>

1299
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:42,749
<i>a series of killings in
European cities last year.</i>

1300
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,291
<i>Was the CIA involved
in those operations?</i>

1301
01:53:45,292 --> 01:53:47,874
<i>You would not expect
me to answer that.</i>

1302
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:51,582
<i>NBC. Is the whistleblower
still employed by the agency?</i>

1303
01:53:51,583 --> 01:53:54,167
<i>I can confirm that
the officer is safe.</i>

1304
01:53:54,583 --> 01:53:57,042
<i>And that they will continue
to serve with the agency.</i>

1305
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:42,458
Who's the Uber driver now?

1306
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:46,167
You must be running
out of lives.

1307
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,750
And you keep on
surprising me, Charlie.

1308
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:51,874
Everything you taught me.

1309
01:54:51,875 --> 01:54:55,291
No, no. What you've done,
what you've become...

1310
01:54:55,292 --> 01:54:56,750
can't teach that.

1311
01:54:58,417 --> 01:55:00,916
I guess I just suddenly
saw what needed doing.

1312
01:55:00,917 --> 01:55:02,000
Yeah.

1313
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:04,417
When no one else did.

1314
01:55:05,667 --> 01:55:06,667
Thank you.

1315
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,708
See you around, Charlie.
